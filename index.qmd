**Hello! Welcome to my Page!**

This website is crafted as part of a module's requirement for the Master's programme (Geospatial Analytics & Application) under the esteemed guidance of A/Prof KAM Tin Seong.

**Motivation in Undertaking Geospatial Analytics**

Inspired by the pioneering work of John Snow in epidemiology, whose spatial mapping of cholera outbreaks in the 1850s revolutionized disease tracking, I aim to apply these principles to contemporary challenges, using spatial data to analyze patterns, uncover insights, and contribute to more informed decision-making in fields like public health and beyond, especially with the rise of Mpox.
